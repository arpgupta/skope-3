About this Release:

    This release of Skope is the first public ALPHA release. It has not yet
    been approved for public BETA is only for evaluation purposes.

    Future polish and features are coming. This copy of Skope is 
    designated "Skope 3" and is its own separate product. It does not 
    share any code with the original Skope and represents a large 
    investment of time. 

    All features of the original Skope will be implemented as soon as
    possible. As always, I welcome emails, questions, and offers of 
    help, but I can not provide definite ETAs for features.

    You may use this application according to the terms of the GNU GPL
    license. My only request is that any modifications to the code be
    contributed to the original project so that the community may reap
    the benefits.

    The main application is mostly functional, however, the installer
    still has major issues. I recommend avoiding using it until changes
    have been made.
